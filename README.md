# School Administration

The program simulates a day in a school along with subjects, courses, instructors and students. At the end of the day it displays the current state of the school.

The command to run the school will be:

java Administrator [filename.txt] [numberOfDays] - where the filename contains almost the same information as mySchool.txt, and numberOfDays means how many days the school should run

Each course can now add the certificates required to be had by the student before attempting it.
The user can now add the certificates required by the students for them to sign up for the class.
example:

subject:Basics,1,1,5 - the subject has no requirements.

subject:Lab 1,2,2,2,1 - the subject requires the student to have the certificate with ID 1.

subject:Arrays,3,1,4,1,3 - the subject requires the student to have the certificates 1 and 3.
